# Note Splitter

Splits notes in plaintext files (such as .md or .txt files) into multiple smaller files. 

## Who is this for?
Everyone who is optimizing their workflow, wants lots of options, or both.

This includes:  
* People who need to split files on a regular basis, such as some researchers. Note Splitter's main purpose is to integrate with workflows to make them easier and faster. These workflows tend to involve splitting by headers of a specific level, creating index files and backlinks, and copying tags, frontmatter, and footnotes into each of the new files.
* People who only need to split one file, or only one every once in a while. Note Splitter is versatile and easy to customize. You can split by almost any feature of text that you can describe.

Note Splitter is currently in the early phases of development. If this application sounds like it could be helpful to you, please [share your workflow](https://github.com/wheelercj/note-splitter/discussions/17) so we might be able to automate it!
