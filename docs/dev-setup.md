# development environment setup

Here are some notes that might help with setting up your development environment while working on Note Splitter.

We're using Python 3.7.9, but newer versions should work too.

## dependencies
You will need to use a few commands before you can run the code:
* `python -m pip install -e .` to locally install Note Splitter and its dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
* `python -m pip install -r .\requirements_dev.txt` to install the dependencies for development.

**when the dependencies change**
* Update the appropriate requirements file (and use its corresponding command again if a dependency was added).
* Update docs/environment.yaml.

## launch.json
If you use a launch.json file to keep track of how to run programs, below is an example for this project that I use with VS Code. Most/all of it should be automatically generated by your IDE, but maybe the "name" or "program" fields will require an adjustment.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: main.py (Integrated Terminal)",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/note_splitter/main.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
```

## directory structure
Here are descriptions of what each of Note Splitter's folders are for:

```
.
├── docs               # Files for documentation (.md and .rst) and for configuration.
│   └── images         # Images used in the documentation and/or the README.
├── src                # The source code for Note Splitter and any other relevant packages.
│   └── note_splitter  # The source code for Note Splitter.
└── tests              # Automated tests.
```

## automated testing
To run the automated tests for Note Splitter, use the `pytest` command. If you're looking for how to run the automated tests for the documentation, see [how to maintain this documentation](how-to-doc.rst).
