# development environment setup

Here are some notes that might help with setting up your development environment while working on Note Splitter.

We're using Python 3.7.9, but newer versions should work too.

You will need to use a few commands before you can run the code:
* `pip install pyyaml`, a third-party dependency.
* `python -m pip install -e .` to install Note Splitter locally.

If you use a launch.json file to keep track of how to run programs, below is an example for this project that I use with VS Code. Most/all of it should be automatically generated by your IDE, but maybe the "name" or "program" fields will require an adjustment.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: main.py (Integrated Terminal)",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/note_splitter/main.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
```

If you want to locally build the documentation (in the docs folder) to test it, you will also need these:
* `pip install -U Sphinx`
* `pip install -U myst-parser`
* `pip install sphinx-rtd-theme`

## how to fully test the project locally
1. run Note Splitter, i.e. src/note_splitter/main.py
2. run scripts/token_hierarchy.py
3. build the docs with `cd docs` and either `make html` or `.\make html`

If any of these give an error message, then something needs to be fixed.
