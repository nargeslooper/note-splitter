# development environment setup

Here are some notes that might help with setting up your development environment while working on Note Splitter.

We're using Python 3.7.9, but newer versions should work too.

You will need to use a few commands before you can run the code:
* `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install our third-party dependencies.
* `python -m pip install -e .` to install Note Splitter locally.

If you use a launch.json file to keep track of how to run programs, below is an example for this project that I use with VS Code. Most/all of it should be automatically generated by your IDE, but maybe the "name" or "program" fields will require an adjustment.

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: main.py (Integrated Terminal)",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/src/note_splitter/main.py",
            "console": "integratedTerminal"
        }
    ]
}
```

## directory structure

Here are descriptions of what each of Note Splitter's folders are for:

```
.
├── docs               # Files for documentation (.md and .rst) and for configuration.
│   └── images         # Images used in the documentation and/or the README.
├── scripts            # Single-file programs that help with maintaining this project.
├── src                # The source code for Note Splitter and any other relevant packages.
│   └── note_splitter  # The source code for Note Splitter.
└── tests              # Automated tests.
```
